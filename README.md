Sentiment Analysis

For it to work correctly you should extract the csv database from the zip file.
I have added the model and the files that are created when creating it as they are needed for later.
Nothing happens if they are deleted because if it does not find the model it will recreate the model and these files but it really takes a long time so I have added them to skip this step.
